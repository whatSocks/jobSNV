[[introduction]]
== Introduction to GraphGist

Introduction content. Briefly introduce the graphgist and problems it solves. 


[[the_network]]
== The Network used in GraphGist

Briefly describe the network. 

Describe your nodes. 

Describe your relationships.

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
//create the nodes
CREATE 	(`Bob`:sample), (`Gregory`:sample)

//create the relationships
CREATE	(`Bob`)-[:LINKS]->(`Gregory`)
RETURN *
