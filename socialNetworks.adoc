== Introduction to GraphGist


[[the_network]]
== The Network used in GraphGist

=== _Briefly describe the network._

Describe a job networking platform with:

==== nodes & relationships:

users: Can be looking for work or not looking for work

jobs: Posted by companies, connected to by users, associated with skills

skills: Associated with users and jobs

user groups: Associated with users

==== from the company user POV

Professional networking sites are used, among other things, for companies to advertise & close job postings to candidates with traits they like and not traits they don't like (precision vs recall). 

==== from the individual user POV (terminology overload - companies are also users, perhaps call users-of-the-graph and users-of-the-socual-network-product something different)

Aside from generic social brownie points things, users are mostly interested in getting jobs in their area of skill. 

==== Abstractions & Assumptions

- There's no time but the present
- Multiple people can have the same job, but jobs can only belong to one company (taking away the need for the 3-node solution)
- Aside from id and a name, nodes don't have other traits, this emphasizes the power of the connections in this example

== _Briefly describe the problem._

From the company POV, paying for job ads is costly, they want to have high precision. Can the social network offer companies a "you should advertise in XYZ group" recommendation feature? 

What would recommendation be based on?

- Find groups that current employees are part of 
- Find groups that high-value users with target skill are part of
-- See Aardvark example on how they select the best experts: experts that have a lot more friends with similar skills/knowledge give higher quality responses, maybe the same thing will happen here

From the user POV, users want to be in a position where companies think they are high-value assets even though they may have less than ideal experience in the field (thus the quest for employment). 

Can the social networking application offer some suggestions as to how to improve results? Same as above, with one change:

- Find groups that current employees of companies with _open_ jobs with relevant skills are members of

What might be a less good idea:

- Find groups with other users that have relevant skills are members of (this seems like a good idea for general networking and education, but perhaps it's naive - these groups may be too general)
-- this might give good recall, but poor precision
